    "description": "This cumin- and paprika-spiced number gets added punch from an addictively tangy green sauce and a crisp, bright avocado and cucumber salad. Spatchcocking—an easy and fun technique that involves removing the backbone to “flatten” the bird before cooking—makes for quick roasting and produces juicy results.",
